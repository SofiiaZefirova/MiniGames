# Snake Game 
**Snake** is a PC game that first appeared in the Nokia 6110 feature phone. 
Developed by Finnish developer Taneli Armanto and published by Nokia. 
In this game, the player controls a thin snake-like creature that moves around the playing field without stopping. 
The goal is to eat as much food as possible during the game. Each time the snake eats food, it becomes longer, which complicates the further process of the game. 
At the same time, the snake must avoid collisions with walls and its own body.

# Game control
- The user controls the body of the snake from the keyboard using the arrows: ←Left, →Right, ↑Up, ↓Down;
- The snake collects symbols on the screen that appear randomly;
- The user can see the current result by Score points;
- If the game is over, then the user sees the message "Game Over" in the center of the playing field.
